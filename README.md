# Using Auto Scaling In AWS Linux

Using simple commands with the AWS CLI, you first create a virtual server (EC2 instance) to run a web server. Then, you make a reusable copy of that server, called an AMI. This copy is used to automatically launch more servers when needed, using a feature called Auto Scaling, which adds or removes servers based on traffic. To keep everything running smoothly, a Load Balancer is set up to share the traffic evenly across all servers, even if theyâ€™re in different locations.

# STEP 1: CREATING A NEW AMI FOR AMAZON EC2 AUTO SCALING

   **Connecting to the Command Host Instance**


You use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to the Command Host EC2 instance that was created when the lab was provisioned. You use this instance to run AWS CLI commands.

1.1 On the AWS Management Console, in the Search bar, enter and choose EC2 to open the EC2 Management Console > In the navigation pane, choose Instances.

1.2 From the list of instances, select the  Command Host instance > Choose Connect > On the EC2 Instance Connect tab, choose Connect.

1.3 To confirm that the Region in which the Command Host instance is running is the same as the lab (the us-west-2 Region), run the following command:






<img width="475" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3697a2c-de13-4d2d-84e5-1d0e3a5e1a98" />


1.4 To update the AWS CLI software with the correct credentials, run the following command:





<img width="503" height="28" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f8b6b53-2737-4732-aba8-dde6c6f177ee" />

  **Creating A New EC2 Instance**

Use the AWS CLI to create a new instance that hosts a web server. 


1.6 To inspect the UserData.txt script that was installed for you as part of the Command Host creation, run the following command:







  
<img width="491" height="33" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501500f1-d7c6-4642-8fb0-283c2ebdda77" />

_These lines erase any history or security information that might have accidentally been left on the instance when the image was taken._

At the bottom of this page, On Lab Details, copy the following:

Copy the **KEYNAME**, **AMIID**, **HTTPACCESS**, and **SUBNETID** values into a text editor document.



1.7 In the following script, replace the corresponding text with the values from the previous step.







<img width="504" height="174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c21102c9-b197-4356-9bdf-a5041a374323" />








<img width="1573" height="85" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08feb154-0cfd-4218-9f0a-111de703daf4" />







Enter your modified script into the terminal window, and run the script.

1.7 The output of this command provides you with an InstanceId. Subsequent steps in this lab refer to this value as NEW-INSTANCE-ID. Replace this value as needed throughout this lab > Copy and paste the InstanceId value into a text editor to use later. 

1.8 To use the aws ec2 wait instance-running command to monitor this instance's status, replace NEW-INSTANCE-ID in the following command with the InstanceID value that you copied in the previous step. Run your modified command. 








<img width="499" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9003f11f-94fb-4a92-bbb7-b203f061838f" />

_Wait for the command to return to a prompt before proceeding.

Your instance starts a new web server. To test that the web server was installed properly, you must obtain the public DNS name._


1.9  To obtain the public DNS name, in the following command, replace NEW-INSTANCE-ID with the value that you copied previously, and run your modified command:






<img width="719" height="55" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07075809-2067-4682-bda2-af2b09acec94" />

1.10 Copy the output of this command without the quotation marks. 

   The value of this output is referred to as PUBLIC-DNS-ADDRESS in the next steps.


1.11 In a new browser tab, enter the output that you copied from the previous step.

   It could take a few minutes for the web server to be installed. Wait 5 minutes before continuing to the next steps.


  Do not choose Start Stress at this stage.

1.12 In the following command, replace _PUBLIC-DNS-ADDRESS_ with the value that you copied in the previous steps, and then run your modified command.







<img width="502" height="41" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e63b09cd-813a-469c-aef6-4e256e7db7ef" />

# STEP 2: CREATING AN AUTO SCALING ENVIRONMENT

**Creating an Application Load Balancer**

2.1 On the EC2 Management Console, in the left navigation pane, locate the Load Balancing section, and choose Load Balancers > Choose Create load balancer.

2.2 In the Load balancer types section, for Application Load Balancer, choose Create.

2.3 On the Create Application Load Balancer page, in the Basic configuration section, configure the following option:

   * For Load balancer name, enter _WebServerELB_






2.4   <img width="508" height="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aebe20d-c716-4c08-bd21-6fcaf31d3263" />




2.5 In the Security groups section, choose the X for the default security group to remove it > From the Security groups dropdown list, choose HTTPAccess.

The HTTPAccess security group has already been created for you, which permits HTTP access.

2.6 In the Listeners and routing section, choose the Create target group link.

Note: This link opens a new browser tab with the Create target group configuration options.

2.7 On the Specify group details page, in the Basic configuration section, configure the following options:

  * For Choose a target type, choose Instances.

  * For Target group name, enter webserver-app

2.8 In the Health checks section, for Health check path, enter /index.php > At the bottom of the page, choose Next.

2.9 On the Register targets page, choose Create target group.

Once the target group has been created successfully, close the Target groups browser tab.

2.10 Return to the Load balancers browser tab, and locate the Listeners and routing section. For Default action, choose  Refresh to the right of the Forward to dropdown list.

2.11 From the Forward to dropdown list, choose webserver-app > From the Forward to dropdown list, choose webserver-app.

2.12 To view the WebServerELB load balancer that you created, choose View load balancer > To copy the DNS name of the load balancer, use the copy option , and paste the DNS name into a text editor. 

**Creating a launch template**

2.13  On the EC2 Management Console, in the left navigation pane, locate the **Instances** section, and choose **Launch Templates**.

2.14 Choose Create launch template.

2.15 On the Create launch template page, in the Launch template name and description section, configure the following options:

   * For **Launch template name - required**, enter _web-app-launch-template_

   * For **Template version description**, enter _A web server for the load test app_

   * For **Auto Scaling guidance**, select  **Provide guidance to help me set up a template that I can use with EC2 Auto Scaling**.

2.16 In the **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image) - required** section, choose the **My AMIs** tab. 

Notice that **WebServerAMI** is already chosen.

2.16 In the **Instance type** section, choose the **Instance type** dropdown list, and choose **t3.micro**.

2.17 In the **Key pair (login)** section, confirm that the **Key pair name** dropdown list is set to **Don't include in launch template**.

 _Amazon EC2 uses public key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. To log in to your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the key pair when you launch the instance, and provide the private key when you connect to the instance._

 2.18 In the **Network settings** section, choose the **Security groups** dropdown list, and choose **HTTPAccess**.

When you launch an instance, you can pass user data to the instance. The data can be used to run configuration tasks and scripts.

2.19 Choose **Create launch template**.

You should receive a message similar to the following:

_Successfully created web-app-launch-template._

* Note: In this lab, you do not need to connect to the instance.

2.20 Choose View launch templates.


**Creating anAuto Scaling Group**

2.21 Choose  **web-app-launch-template**, and then from the Actions  dropdown list, choose **Create Auto Scaling group**.

2.12 On the **Choose launch template or configuration** page, in the **Name** section, for **Auto Scaling group name**, enter _Web App Auto Scaling Group_ > Choose **Next**

2.13 On the Choose instance launch options page, in the Network section, configure the following options:

  * From the **VPC** dropdown list, choose **Lab VPC**.

  * From the **Availability Zones and subnets** dropdown list, choose **Private Subnet 1 (10.0.2.0/24)** and **Private Subnet 2 (10.0.4.0/24)** > Choose **Next**

2.14 On the Configure advanced options â€“ optional page, configure the following options: 

   * In the **Load balancing â€“ optional** section, choose **Attach to an existing load balancer**.

   * In the **Attach to an existing load balancer** section, configure the following options:

   * Choose **Choose from your load balancer target groups.**

   * From the **Existing load balancer target groups** dropdown list, choose **webserver-app | HTTP.**

   * In the **Health checks** section, under **Additional health check types**, select  **Turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks.** > Choose **Next**

2.15 On the **Configure group size and scaling policies â€“ optional** page, configure the following options: 

In the **Group size â€“ optional** section, enter the following values: 

  * **Desired capacity**:2

  * **Minimum capacity**: 2
    
  * **Maximum capacity**: 4

In the Scaling policies â€“ optional section, configure the following options:

Choose  **Target tracking scaling policy**.

For **Metric type**, choose **Average CPU utilization**.

For **Target value**, enter 50

This change tells auto scaling to maintain an average CPU utilization across all instances of 50 percent. Auto scaling automatically adds or removes capacity as required to keep the metric at or close to the specified target value. It adjusts to fluctuations in the metric due to a fluctuating load pattern.

2.16 Choose **Next**.

2.17 On the **Add notifications â€“ optional** page, choose **Next**.

2.18 On the **Add tags â€“ optional **page, choose **Add tag** and configure the following options:

  * For **Key**, enter _Name_

  * For **Value - optional**, enter _WebApp_

2.19 Choose **Next**.

2.20 On the **Review** page, choose **Create Auto Scaling group.**

These options launch EC2 instances in private subnets across both Availability Zones.

Your Auto Scaling group initially shows an Instances count of zero, but new instances will be launched to reach the desired count of two instances.

Note: If you experience an error related to the t3.micro instance type not being available, then rerun this task by choosing the t2.micro instance type instead.

# STEP 3: VERIFYING THE AUTO SCALING CONFIGURATION

3.1 In the left navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

Two new instances named **WebApp** are being created as part of your Auto Scaling group. While these instances are being created, the **Status check** for these two instances is Initializing.

Observe the **Status check** field for the instances until the status is 2/2 checks passed. Wait for the two new instances to complete initialization before you proceed to the next step. 

You might need to choose  **Refresh** to see the updated status.

3.2 Once the instances have completed initialization, in the left navigation pane in the **Load Balancing** section, choose **Target Groups**, and then select  your target group, **webserver-app**.

3.3 On the **Targets** tab, verify that two instances are being created. Refresh this list until the **Health status** of these instances changes to _healthy_.

   You can now test the web application by accessing it through the load balancer.

# STEP 4: TESTING AUTO SCALING CONFIGURATION 

4.1 Open a new web browser tab, and paste the **DNS name** of the load balancer that you copied earlier into the address bar, and press Enter.

4.2 On the web page, choose **Start Stress**.

This step calls the application **stress** in the background, which causes the CPU utilization on the instance that serviced this request to spike to 100 percent.

4.3 On the EC2 Management console, in the left navigation pane in the **Auto Scaling** section, choose **Auto Scaling Groups**.

4.4 Select  **Web App Auto Scaling Group**.

4.5 Choose the **Activity** tab. 

After a few minutes, you should see your Auto Scaling group add a new instance. This occurs because Amazon CloudWatch detected that the average CPU utilization of your Auto Scaling group exceeded 50 percent, and your scale-up policy has been invoked in response.

You can also check the new instances being launched on the EC2 Dashboard.

    Well Done!! You now have successfully done the following:
    
    * Created an EC2 instance by using an AWS CLI command
    
    * Created a new AMI by using the AWS CLI
    
    * Created an Amazon EC2 launch template
    
    * Created an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launch configuration
    
    * Configured scaling policies and created an Auto Scaling group to scale in and scale out the number of servers based on variable load
